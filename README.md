# NodeJS Service

This NodeJS service aggregates data from two different API's. The two endpoints in the service perform the following tasks:

* The `/` endpoint returns an array of products that include all the products' name, price and inventory.

* The `/:name` endpoint returns the name, price and inventory for a single product.
